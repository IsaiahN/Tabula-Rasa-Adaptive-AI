## Key Features

### 1. Bootstrap Protection

Newborn agents receive protection during their first 10,000 steps:
- 90% reduction in energy costs
- Simplified environment complexity
- Guaranteed food accessibility
- Larger LP smoothing windows

### 2. Learning Progress Validation

The LP drive includes extensive validation measures:
- Signal-to-noise ratio monitoring
- Stability score tracking
- Outlier detection and rejection
- Automated quality assessment

### 3. Memory Management

DNC memory system with:
- 512 memory slots × 64 word size
- Usage-based importance scoring
- Co-activation bonuses for related memories
- Regularization to encourage memory use

### 4. Adaptive Complexity

Environment complexity increases automatically when:
- Agent achieves >80% survival rate
- Learning progress is stable and positive
- Performance variance is low

## Usage

### Basic Training

```bash
# Run with default configuration
python src/main_training.py

# Run with custom configuration
python src/main_training.py --config configs/phase1_config.yaml

# Resume from checkpoint
python src/main_training.py --checkpoint ./checkpoints/agent_episode_50.pt

# Custom episode count
python src/main_training.py --episodes 200
```

### Testing Basic Functionality

```bash
# Run basic functionality tests
python src/test_basic_functionality.py
```

### Configuration

The system is configured through YAML files:
- `configs/phase1_config.yaml`: Main Phase 1 configuration
- All hyperparameters are externalized and configurable
- Component-specific settings grouped logically

## Critical Risk Mitigation

### 1. Learning Progress Drive

- **Offline Validation**: LP signal tested on recorded data before integration
- **Stability Measures**: Extensive smoothing, outlier rejection, derivative clamping
- **Fixed Weights**: Start with 0.7/0.3 LP/empowerment split, no adaptive logic initially
- **Validation Metrics**: Automated signal quality assessment

### 2. Memory System

- **Proven Architecture**: DNC with gradient flow monitoring
- **Regularization**: Encourage memory use over hidden state reliance
- **Usage Monitoring**: Track memory utilization with automated alerts
- **Ablation Testing**: Compare performance with/without external memory

### 3. Bootstrap Problem

- **Protected Learning Period**: 10,000 steps with reduced energy costs
- **Simplified Environment**: Fewer objects, slower dynamics initially
- **Guaranteed Resources**: Food sources always accessible during bootstrap
- **LP Signal Smoothing**: Larger smoothing windows during protection

## Performance Targets

### Phase 1 Success Criteria

- **Survival Rate**: >80% after 20+ episodes
- **Learning Progress**: Stable positive signal without oscillations
- **Memory Utilization**: >10% external memory usage
- **Goal Achievement**: Consistent survival goal completion
- **Post-Death Recovery**: Quick recovery after death/reset

### Validation Requirements

- **LP Signal Stability**: Signal-to-noise ratio >2.0, stability score >0.8
- **Memory Efficiency**: 80%+ retention of important patterns after sleep
- **Energy Management**: Survival rate >80% in resource-scarce environments
- **Component Integration**: All systems work together without conflicts

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

Once Phase 1 is validated:

1. **Template-Based Goals**: Parameterized goals like "reach location (x,y)"
2. **Adaptive Curriculum**: Automatic environment complexity scaling
3. **Learned Memory Importance**: REINFORCE training for memory preservation
4. **Advanced Visualization**: Real-time monitoring dashboards
5. **RL Policy Integration**: Replace random actions with learned policy

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **High Death Rate**: Reduce energy consumption parameters
2. **Low Learning Progress**: Check LP signal quality, increase smoothing window
3. **Memory Not Used**: Check regularization terms, reduce hidden state size
4. **Unstable Training**: Reduce learning rates, increase stability measures

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging by setting log level to DEBUG:
```python
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

### Performance Monitoring

Monitor key metrics:
- LP signal quality and stability
- Memory utilization patterns
- Energy consumption trends
- Goal achievement rates

## Dependencies

- **PyTorch**: 1.9+ for neural network components
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations
- **PyYAML**: For configuration management
- **Matplotlib**: For visualization (optional)

## Conclusion

Phase 1 implements the foundational components for an adaptive learning agent with intrinsic motivation. The focus is on stability and validation rather than performance optimization. Once the core system is proven stable, Phase 2 will add complexity and advanced features.

**Key Success Factor**: The learning progress drive must be extensively validated before any advanced features are implemented. This component is the foundation of the entire system and must be rock-solid.
