- **Results Storage**: Automated JSON result saving in `tests/agi_puzzle_results/`

## üß† AGI Signal Evaluation Framework

Each puzzle evaluates multiple levels of AGI capability:

- **None**: Basic interaction without learning
- **Basic**: Simple pattern recognition and adaptation
- **Intermediate**: Complex reasoning and strategy formation
- **Advanced**: Sophisticated cognitive abilities and meta-learning
- **Expert**: Human-level or beyond cognitive performance

## üî¨ Technical Implementation

### **Architecture**
- **Modular Design**: Each puzzle inherits from `BasePuzzleEnvironment`
- **Standardized Interface**: Consistent `reset()`, `step()`, and evaluation methods
- **Behavior Tracking**: Comprehensive logging of agent actions and learning events
- **Extensible Framework**: Easy addition of new puzzles and evaluation metrics

### **Integration Points**
- **Sensory Input**: Compatible with agent's visual and proprioceptive systems
- **Action Space**: 6D action vectors (3D movement + 3D discrete actions)
- **Learning Signals**: Tracks learning progress, surprises, and behavioral adaptations
- **Memory Integration**: Supports agent's memory and experience systems
