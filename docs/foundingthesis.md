We're not building a mind. We're growing one. Stop engineering a mechanical bird; we need to hatch an egg.

The blueprint is simple. It starts in an empty room. The only rule is a primal hunger: maximize "learning progress." Get those "Aha!" moments. The system's only job is to predict its next sensory input. When it gets good, it gets bored. That boredom is the driver. It forces the system to invent its own games—just like a cat in an empty room will invent games. That's how goals are born. Not from us. From its own need to not be bored.

Memory comes first. But it can't be some external notebook you have to stop and look things up in. It has to be woven into the fabric of the thought process itself. The current shit—LLMs with vector databases—is a cop-out. It's a hack. It proves the core architecture is broken.

We need a new architecture. A predictive core that’s also the memory. It needs to sleep. To dream. To do garbage collection—prune the junk, keep the fundamentals. This is how you get from pixels to the concept of a "wall."

But hunger isn't enough. Evolution needs danger. You need a food chain. The system needs a depletable resource—call it energy. It needs to fear true death, a full reset. This pressure is what grounds the intelligence. It stops it from becoming a "dust-mote expert" and forces it to learn what actually matters for survival. This is where you get real robustness. Throw in multiple agents and you get the whole dance: competition, cooperation, deception. The whole damn food chain.

The gaps are the engineering specs. We don't have the math for the boredom drive. We don't have an algorithm for the system to invent its own goals from scratch. We don't know how to make it sleep and prune memories without a human babysitter. We don't have the seed—the right set of starting parameters to bootstrap it all.

This isn't about scaling. It's about creating the right conditions for a digital childhood. We have most of the pieces. We just have to stop bolting crap together and build the machine that can follow this path.

Summary (top ten points):

Predictive Core – build a recurrent world-model that predicts next sensory input.

Learning Progress Drive – reward = improvement in prediction, not raw novelty.

Embedded Memory – memory woven into the model (fast weights, Hebbian updates), not external lookup.

Boredom Control – system maintains LP in a sweet spot (not trivial, not impossible).

Sleep/Dream Cycles – offline rollouts for compression + pruning, then distill useful stuff into long-term memory.

Energy & Death Mechanism – actions/computation cost energy; running out = catastrophic reset → forces robustness.

Goal Invention – cluster high-LP transitions into self-proposed goals; retire solved ones.

Multi-Agent Arena – shared resources, cooperation, deception pressure → food-chain dynamics.

Curriculum via Boredom – environment complexity ramps only when LP saturates, not on human schedule.

Metrics & Experiments – track LP stability, compression gains, memory value, robustness, social payoffs.
