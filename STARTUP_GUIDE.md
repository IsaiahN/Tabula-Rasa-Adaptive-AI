# ðŸ§  HOW TO START YOUR META-COGNITIVE ARC SYSTEM

## ðŸš€ QUICK START (Recommended)

**For continuous training with full meta-cognitive system:**
```bash
python start_meta_cognitive_training.py
```

This will:
- âœ… Start continuous training loop
- âœ… Activate Governor (Third Brain) for adaptive decisions  
- âœ… Activate Architect (Zeroth Brain) for self-modification
- âœ… Run console dashboard for real-time monitoring
- âœ… Auto-restart sessions with performance tracking
- âœ… Graceful shutdown with Ctrl+C

## ðŸŽ® DASHBOARD OPTIONS

**GUI Dashboard (recommended for monitoring):**
```bash
python start_meta_cognitive_training.py --dashboard gui
```

**Console Dashboard (works anywhere):**
```bash  
python start_meta_cognitive_training.py --dashboard console
```

**Headless Mode (background operation):**
```bash
python start_meta_cognitive_training.py --dashboard headless
```

## ðŸ”¬ TRAINING MODES

**Demo Mode (shorter sessions for testing):**
```bash
python start_meta_cognitive_training.py --mode demo --dashboard gui
```

**Research Mode (system comparison and analysis):**
```bash
python start_meta_cognitive_training.py --mode research --dashboard console
```

**Full Continuous Mode (production training):**
```bash
python start_meta_cognitive_training.py --mode continuous --dashboard gui
```

## ðŸ§  WHAT'S RUNNING

When you start the system, you get:

1. **ðŸ§  Primary Brain**: All 37 cognitive systems from UnifiedTrainer
2. **ðŸ§  Third Brain**: Governor monitoring performance and making recommendations  
3. **ðŸ§  Zeroth Brain**: Architect evolving the neural architecture
4. **ðŸ“Š Dashboard**: Real-time monitoring of all meta-cognitive decisions
5. **ðŸ”„ Continuous Loop**: Auto-restart sessions with adaptive timing

## ðŸ“Š MONITORING & CONTROL

- **Real-time metrics**: Win rates, scores, confidence levels
- **Decision logging**: Every Governor recommendation tracked
- **Evolution tracking**: Architect mutations and improvements  
- **Session export**: All data saved for analysis
- **Graceful shutdown**: Ctrl+C stops cleanly and saves state

## ðŸ”§ ALTERNATIVE ENTRY POINTS

**Legacy unified trainer (if you need it):**
```bash
python unified_arc_trainer.py --verbose
```

**Direct meta-cognitive demo:**
```bash
python real_arc_training_with_metacognition.py
```

**Dashboard testing only:**
```bash
python test_dashboard.py
```

## ðŸŽ¯ RECOMMENDED WORKFLOW

1. **Start with demo mode** to see the system working:
   ```bash
   python start_meta_cognitive_training.py --mode demo --dashboard gui
   ```

2. **Once satisfied, run continuous mode:**
   ```bash  
   python start_meta_cognitive_training.py --dashboard gui
   ```

3. **Let it run continuously** - it will:
   - Adapt strategies based on performance
   - Evolve its neural architecture automatically  
   - Learn patterns across sessions
   - Provide real-time feedback

4. **Monitor progress** via the dashboard and exported session data

## ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT NOTES

- **The system is now fully autonomous** - no manual intervention needed
- **Governor makes training strategy decisions** automatically  
- **Architect evolves the neural architecture** in the background
- **Cross-session learning** improves performance over time
- **All decisions are logged** for analysis and debugging

**Start your journey to AGI with:**
```bash
python start_meta_cognitive_training.py --dashboard gui
```

ðŸŽ‰ **Your meta-cognitive ARC system is ready for continuous learning!**
