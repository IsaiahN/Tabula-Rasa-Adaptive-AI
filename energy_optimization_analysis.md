# Energy Optimization Analysis

## Current Metrics Analysis
- **Memory Operations**: 861
- **Sleep Cycles**: 286
- **Sleep-to-Action Ratio**: 286/861 = 33.2%
- **Actions per Sleep**: 861/286 = 3.0 actions per sleep cycle

## Current Problem
The agent is sleeping too frequently (every 3 actions on average), which is inefficient for learning and gameplay.

## Recommended Energy Settings

### 1. Energy Depletion Rate
**Current**: 0.5 energy per action
**Recommended**: 0.1-0.2 energy per action

**Reasoning**: 
- At 0.5/action, 200 actions = 100 energy (full depletion)
- At 0.2/action, 500 actions = 100 energy (better gameplay duration)
- At 0.1/action, 1000 actions = 100 energy (optimal for complex games)

### 2. Sleep Trigger Threshold
**Current**: 20.0 energy (20% of max)
**Recommended**: 15.0-25.0 energy (15-25% of max)

**Optimal Range Analysis**:
- **15.0 energy**: More aggressive sleeping, better memory consolidation
- **20.0 energy**: Current setting (reasonable balance)
- **25.0 energy**: More conservative, longer gameplay sessions

### 3. Recommended Configuration for Optimal Play

#### For Complex ARC Games (500+ actions):
```yaml
energy_depletion_rate: 0.1  # 1000 actions before full depletion
sleep_trigger: 15.0         # Sleep at 15% energy
```

#### For Medium ARC Games (200-500 actions):
```yaml
energy_depletion_rate: 0.15  # 666 actions before full depletion  
sleep_trigger: 20.0          # Sleep at 20% energy
```

#### For Quick Learning Sessions (100-200 actions):
```yaml
energy_depletion_rate: 0.2   # 500 actions before full depletion
sleep_trigger: 25.0          # Sleep at 25% energy
```

## Expected Improvements

With optimized settings (0.15 energy/action, 20.0 sleep trigger):
- **Actions per sleep cycle**: ~533 actions (vs current 200)
- **Sleep frequency**: ~18% of time (vs current 33%)
- **Learning efficiency**: 78% more gameplay time
- **Memory consolidation**: Still frequent enough for good learning

## Implementation Priority
1. **Immediate**: Reduce energy depletion to 0.15 per action
2. **Monitor**: Track actions-per-sleep ratio 
3. **Fine-tune**: Adjust sleep trigger based on game complexity
