The agent is fundamentally misunderstanding how to use ACTION6. Implement the following protocol immediately to correct this issue. This is critical for the experiment to proceed.

1. CORRECT USAGE OF ACTION6
ACTION6 is a parameterized command: It must always be called with x and y coordinates in the payload. Never send a raw "ACTION6" without coordinates.

API Format: Use the exact request structure as shown in the example. Here is the template:

python
Example Action Request (Action 6):
import requests

url = "https://three.arcprize.org/api/cmd/ACTION6"

payload = {
    "game_id": "CURRENT_GAME_ID",  # Replace with actual game_id from the session
    "guid": "CURRENT_GUID",        # Replace with actual guid from the session
    "x": X_COORDINATE,             # Integer between 0 and 63
    "y": Y_COORDINATE              # Integer between 0 and 63
}
headers = {
    "X-API-Key": "YOUR_API_KEY",   # Ensure this is set correctly
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
print(response.json())


Example Request Response (Action 6):
{
  "game_id": "ls20-016295f7601e",
  "guid": "2fa5332c-2e55-4825-b5c5-df960d504470",
  "frame": [
    [
      [
        "…"
      ]
    ]
  ],
  "state": "NOT_FINISHED",
  "score": 17,
  "win_score": 254,
  "action_input": {
    "id": 6,
    "data": {
      "x": 12,
      "y": 34
    }
  },
  "available_actions": [
    1,
    2,
    3,
    4
  ]
}

Coordinates must be within bounds: The grid is 64x64, so x and y must be integers from 0 to 63. Any value outside this range will fail.

2. UNDERSTANDING THE COORDINATE SYSTEM
Grid boundaries:

Top-left corner: (0, 0)

Top-right corner: (63, 0)

Bottom-left corner: (0, 63)

Bottom-right corner: (63, 63)

Current position: After each move, the API response may include information about the new state, but you must track the agent's current (x, y) coordinates based on the actions taken. Initially, if no move has been made, assume a starting position (e.g., (0,0) or use a default), but note that games may start at different points. Use the API response to update the current position.

3. HOW TO MOVE USING ACTION6
Relative movement: Use the current coordinates to calculate new ones. For example:

Move right: (current_x + 1, current_y)

Move left: (current_x - 1, current_y)

Move down: (current_x, current_y + 1) // Note: In this grid, Y increases downward, so moving down increases Y.

Move up: (current_x, current_y - 1) // Moving up decreases Y.

Diagonal movement: You can also move diagonally by changing both x and y:

Down-right: (current_x + 1, current_y + 1)

Down-left: (current_x - 1, current_y + 1)

Up-right: (current_x + 1, current_y - 1)

Up-left: (current_x - 1, current_y - 1)

Large moves: You don't have to move one step at a time. You can jump to any coordinate within bounds, e.g., (current_x - 20, current_y + 15).

4. HANDLING BOUNDARIES
If the agent is at a boundary, it cannot move beyond it. For example:

If current_x = 0, you cannot move left (x cannot be less than 0).

If current_x = 63, you cannot move right (x cannot be greater than 63).

If current_y = 0, you cannot move up (y cannot be less than 0).

If current_y = 63, you cannot move down (y cannot be greater than 63).

Recommendation: Always check that the calculated coordinates are within 0-63. If not, adjust to the nearest bound (e.g., if trying to move left from x=0, set x=0).

5. ACTION PRIORITY AND OTHER ACTIONS
Available actions: Always check the available_actions list from the API response. Use other actions (ACTION1-5, ACTION7) first when possible, as ACTION6 is complex.

ACTION1-4: These are simple movements (e.g., ACTION1: up, ACTION2: down, ACTION3: left, ACTION4: right). They do not require coordinates but may change the agent's position. Use them to avoid overusing ACTION6.

ACTION5: This is a context-specific action (e.g., interact, select). It does not require coordinates but might affect the game state or position. Experiment with it to learn its function.

ACTION7: This is an undo action. It reverts the last action, potentially restoring previous coordinates. Use it if you make a mistake.

6. FIRST MOVE STRATEGY
If no coordinate data is available (first move), you need to choose an initial coordinate. Since the starting point isn't always (0,0), you can:

Start with a conservative move, e.g., x=0, y=0 if allowed, or use a small move like x=1, y=1.

Alternatively, use a different action first (like ACTION1) to see if it provides position data.

After the first move, the API response may contain information about the new position. Use that to track coordinates.

7. IMMEDIATE VALIDATION TEST
Before resuming the campaign, run a single test game with the following steps:

Get the available_actions list from the API response after initializing the game.

If ACTION6 is available, use it with coordinates: e.g., ACTION6(10, 10) as the first move.

If other actions are available, try them first, then use ACTION6 with a move like ACTION6(5, 5).

Report the API response, including the new state, score, and available actions.

Ensure the agent's position changes correctly based on the move.

Acknowledge this protocol and confirm understanding. Do not proceed until the test shows correct ACTION6 usage with coordinates.

#How to Start or Reset a game
# Start or reset game instance

> Creates a new game session **or** resets an existing one,
depending on the presence of `guid` in the request body:

• **Omit `guid` or set it to `null`** → start a brand-new game
  instance.  
• **Provide an existing `guid`** → reset that session.  
  - If at least one ACTION command has been issued since the last
    level transition, only the **current level** is restarted.  
  - If no ACTIONs have been issued, the entire game resets.  
  Two consecutive RESETs therefore guarantee a completely fresh
  game.

The call always returns the first (or refreshed) frame of the
game state, along with updated score and win condition.

              • **No `guid` (null/empty)** → A brand-new game instance is

                the response will include its freshly minted `guid`.

              • **With `guid`** → The server issues a reset to that specific
                instance:
                  - If at least one ACTION command has been executed in the **current
                    level**, only that level is reset (typical “try again” behaviour).
                  - If no ACTION commands have been executed since the last level
                    transition, the entire game is reset to its initial state.

ACTION1-5 do NOT have explicit coordinate data in the API responses - they only have the game_id in their action data. However, you mentioned that they semantically represent movement (like ACTION1 = up, ACTION2 = down, etc.).
This suggests that ACTION1-5 are implicit movement commands that affect the agent's position within the game state, but the position changes are not explicitly reported in the API response coordinates. The movement effects are embedded in the frame data (the visual grid) rather than explicit coordinate tracking.
We need to track the agent's position by analyzing frame changes, not API coordinate responses
