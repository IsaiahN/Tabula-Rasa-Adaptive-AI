**Key Features:**
```python
# Automatic configuration optimization
- Response Time > 2s: Reduce timeouts, optimize queries
- Error Rate > 5%: Increase retry attempts, reduce learning rate
- Memory Usage > 80%: Reduce cache size, increase cleanup frequency

- âœ… **Emergency Handling**: Handles critical situations across all systems
- âœ… **Metrics Collection**: Collects and aggregates metrics from all systems
- âœ… **Phase Management**: Manages different automation phases

**Key Features:**
```python
# Unified control and coordination
- start_unified_automation("phase_1")
- get_automation_status()
- get_phase_1_status()
- Automatic system coordination
- Health monitoring and recovery
```
