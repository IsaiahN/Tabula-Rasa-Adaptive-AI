# Design Document

## Overview

The Adaptive Learning Agent is built around a core philosophy of emergent intelligence through intrinsic motivation. The system consists of interconnected components that work together to create a digital organism capable of autonomous learning, goal generation, and robust behavior under survival pressure.

The architecture follows a biological metaphor where intelligence emerges from the right environmental conditions rather than explicit programming. The agent develops through a "digital childhood" where curiosity, boredom, and survival instincts drive learning and adaptation.

### Core Processing Loop

1. **Sensory Input Processing**: Raw sensory data enters the predictive core
2. **Prediction Generation**: The core generates predictions for next sensory states
3. **Learning Progress Calculation**: Prediction accuracy changes are computed
4. **Action Selection**: Actions are chosen to maximize learning progress and energy
5. **Memory Update**: Embedded memory is updated through Hebbian-like mechanisms
6. **Goal Management**: High-LP experiences are clustered into potential goals
7. **Energy Management**: Actions consume energy, survival behaviors replenish it

## Components and Interfaces

### 1. Predictive Core

**Architecture**: Recurrent State-Space Model (Mamba/HGRN preferred, LSTM fallback)

**Key Components**:
- **State Encoder**: Converts sensory input to internal state representation
- **Temporal Predictor**: Generates next-state predictions using recurrent dynamics
- **Prediction Head**: Outputs sensory predictions and confidence estimates
- **State Memory**: Maintains temporal context across prediction steps

**Interface**:
```python
class PredictiveCore:
    def forward(self, sensory_input: Tensor, hidden_state: Tensor) -> Tuple[Tensor, Tensor, Tensor]:
        # Returns: prediction, new_hidden_state, confidence
        
    def compute_prediction_error(self, prediction: Tensor, actual: Tensor) -> Tensor:
        # Returns: prediction error magnitude
```

**Implementation Details**:
- Input dimensionality: Configurable (start with 64x64 visual + proprioception)
- Hidden state size: 512-1024 dimensions
- Prediction horizon: 1-5 steps ahead
- Loss function: MSE for continuous, CrossEntropy for discrete sensory modalities

### 2. Learning Progress Drive

**CRITICAL RISK MITIGATION**: The LP drive is the highest-risk component. Implementation requires extensive validation.

**Core Algorithm (with stability measures)**: 
```
# Multi-modal normalization
normalized_error_i = prediction_error_i / running_std_i
# Robust smoothing with outlier rejection
smooth_error = exponential_moving_average(normalized_error, alpha=0.01)
# Clamped derivative to prevent noise amplification
LP(t) = clamp(-d(smooth_error)/dt, min=-1.0, max=1.0)
# Hybrid reward with fallback
reward(t) = 0.7 * LP(t) + 0.3 * empowerment_bonus(t)
```

**Validation Requirements**:
- **Offline Testing**: Must validate LP signal stability on recorded data streams before integration
- **Modality Normalization**: Per-sensory-channel error normalization using running statistics
- **Cheat Detection**: Monitor for "dark corner" exploits via environmental diversity metrics
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Empowerment-based intrinsic motivation as backup reward signal

**Components**:
- **Error Tracker**: Maintains per-modality running statistics and moving averages
- **Progress Calculator**: Computes robust derivative with outlier rejection
- **Reward Generator**: Hybrid LP + empowerment reward with configurable mixing
- **Exploit Detector**: Monitors environmental diversity to detect reward hacking

**Interface**:
```python
class LearningProgressDrive:
    def compute_reward(self, prediction_error: Tensor) -> Tensor:
        # Returns: intrinsic reward signal
        
    def is_bored(self) -> bool:
        # Returns: True if LP has been near zero for threshold steps
        
    def reset_boredom_counter(self):
        # Called when new goals are invented or complexity increases
```

**Parameters**:
- Smoothing window: 100-1000 steps
- Boredom threshold: LP < 0.01 for 500+ steps
- Reward scaling: Configurable multiplier for RL integration

### 3. Embedded Memory System

**CRITICAL RISK MITIGATION**: Pure Hebbian updates are unstable. Using proven memory-augmented architecture.

**Architecture**: Differentiable Neural Computer (DNC) with Hebbian-inspired components

**Rationale**: Addresses the "external notebook" critique while providing proven stability and scalability.

**Components**:
- **Content-Addressable Memory**: External memory matrix with read/write heads
- **Hebbian-Inspired Addressing**: Usage-based memory allocation with co-activation bonuses
- **Temporal Linking**: Maintains sequence information for episodic memory
- **Memory Controller**: Learned read/write operations integrated with predictive core

**Interface**:
```python
class EmbeddedMemory:
    def __init__(self, memory_size: int = 512, word_size: int = 64):
        self.memory_matrix = torch.zeros(memory_size, word_size)
        self.usage_vector = torch.zeros(memory_size)
        
    def read_write_step(self, controller_output: Tensor) -> Tuple[Tensor, Tensor]:
        # Returns: read_vectors, updated_memory_state
        
    def hebbian_bonus(self, read_weights: Tensor, write_weights: Tensor):
        # Adds co-activation bonus to memory addressing
```

**Implementation**:
- Memory matrix: 512 x 64 (32KB external memory)
- Addressing: Content + location + Hebbian co-activation bonus
- Stability: Proven DNC architecture with gradient flow
- Integration: Memory reads/writes are part of forward pass

### 4. Sleep and Dream Cycles

**Trigger Conditions**:
- Energy below 20% of maximum
- Boredom detected (low LP for extended period)
- Memory capacity approaching limits
- Scheduled intervals (every N steps)

**Sleep Process**:
1. **Experience Replay**: Sample high-error experiences from replay buffer
2. **Offline Training**: Update predictive core on replayed experiences
3. **Memory Consolidation**: Strengthen important fast weight connections
4. **Pruning**: Remove low-value memories and connections
5. **Distillation**: Compress learned patterns into more efficient representations

**Interface**:
```python
class SleepCycle:
    def should_sleep(self, energy: float, boredom: bool, memory_usage: float) -> bool:
        
    def execute_sleep_cycle(self, replay_buffer: List[Experience]):
        # Performs offline learning and memory consolidation
        
    def dream_rollouts(self, num_rollouts: int):
        # Generates synthetic experiences for learning
```

### 5. Energy and Death System

**Energy Dynamics**:
- Base consumption: 0.01 per step
- Action cost: 0.1-1.0 per action (based on action magnitude)
- Computation cost: Proportional to model forward passes
- Energy sources: Environmental "food" objects (+10.0 energy)
- Maximum energy: 100.0 units

**Death Mechanism**:
- Trigger: Energy â‰¤ 0
- Reset: Agent position, energy, and short-term memory
- Preservation: Core model weights and some long-term memories
- Recovery metric: Time to re-achieve previous performance levels

**Interface**:
```python
class EnergySystem:
    def consume_energy(self, action_cost: float, computation_cost: float):
        
    def add_energy(self, amount: float):
        
    def is_dead(self) -> bool:
        
    def reset_agent(self):
        # Handles death and respawn
```

### 6. Goal Invention System

**CRITICAL RISK MITIGATION**: Phased approach starting with simple, validated goals before attempting emergent discovery.

**Phase 1: Fixed Survival Goals**
- Hard-coded goals: "find food", "avoid death", "maintain energy > 50%"
- Success metric: Binary achievement with clear environmental feedback
- Purpose: Validate energy system and basic RL learning

**Phase 2: Template-Based Goals**
- Goal templates: "reach location (x,y)", "interact with object type X"
- Parameter generation: Random sampling within environment bounds
- Achievement: Clear spatial/interaction criteria

**Phase 3: Emergent Goal Discovery (Future)**
- Experience clustering in validated latent representations
- Goal validation through achievability testing
- Automatic difficulty adjustment based on success rates

**Interface**:
```python
class GoalInvention:
    def __init__(self, phase: str = "survival"):
        self.current_phase = phase
        
    def get_active_goals(self, agent_state: AgentState) -> List[Goal]:
        if self.current_phase == "survival":
            return self._survival_goals(agent_state)
        elif self.current_phase == "template":
            return self._template_goals(agent_state)
            
    def evaluate_achievement(self, goal: Goal, agent_state: AgentState) -> bool:
        # Clear, deterministic achievement criteria
```

**Validation Strategy**:
- Phase 1 must achieve 80%+ survival rate before Phase 2
- Phase 2 must show consistent goal achievement before Phase 3
- Each phase validates core assumptions before adding complexity

### 7. Multi-Agent Arena

**CRITICAL RISK MITIGATION**: Multi-agent complexity is deferred until single-agent system is proven stable.

**Development Phases**:

**Phase 1: Single Agent Validation (Months 1-6)**
- Isolated agent in controlled environment
- Focus: Validate LP drive, memory system, energy mechanics
- Success criteria: Stable learning, goal achievement, survival

**Phase 2: Dual Agent Introduction (Month 7+)**
- Two agents in separate but observable spaces
- Limited interaction: visual observation only
- Purpose: Test system stability under observation

**Phase 3: Competitive Multi-Agent (Month 9+)**
- Shared resources and direct competition
- Full interaction dynamics
- Prerequisite: Both single agents must be independently stable

**Current Implementation (Phase 1 Only)**:
```python
class SingleAgentEnvironment:
    def __init__(self, complexity_level: int = 1):
        self.complexity = complexity_level
        
    def step(self, action: Action) -> Observation:
        # Controlled, debuggable single-agent environment
        
    def increase_complexity(self):
        # Gradual complexity scaling based on agent performance
```

**Rationale**: Multi-agent interactions will amplify any single-agent instabilities. The system must be rock-solid with one agent before introducing the chaos of social dynamics.

    def add_goal(self, goal: Goal):
        
    def retire_goal(self, goal: Goal):
```

## Critical Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Bootstrap Problem Solution

**The Challenge**: Newborn agent with random actions produces massive, noisy prediction errors that could overwhelm the LP drive and cause immediate death.

**Solution - Protected Learning Period**:
```python
class BootstrapManager:
    def __init__(self, protection_steps: int = 10000):
        self.protection_remaining = protection_steps
        
    def is_protected(self) -> bool:
        return self.protection_remaining > 0
        
    def get_modified_energy_cost(self, base_cost: float) -> float:
        if self.is_protected():
            return base_cost * 0.1  # 90% energy cost reduction
        return base_cost
```

**Protection Mechanisms**:
- Reduced energy consumption (90% discount) for first 10k steps
- LP signal smoothing with larger window during bootstrap
- Simplified environment (fewer objects, slower dynamics)
- Guaranteed energy sources within reach

### Hyperparameter Management Strategy

**The Challenge**: The system has 20+ critical hyperparameters that interact in complex ways.

**Solution - Hierarchical Parameter Search**:
1. **Core Parameters First**: LP smoothing window, energy costs, memory decay
2. **Automated Grid Search**: Use Optuna or similar for systematic exploration
3. **Stability Metrics**: Parameters must pass stability tests before performance optimization
4. **Configuration Management**: All parameters externalized to YAML configs

**Critical Parameter Ranges** (validated through simulation):
```yaml
learning_progress:
  smoothing_window: [100, 500, 1000]  # Steps for error smoothing
  derivative_clamp: [-1.0, 1.0]       # Prevent noise amplification
  
energy_system:
  base_consumption: [0.005, 0.01, 0.02]  # Per-step energy cost
  action_multiplier: [0.1, 0.5, 1.0]     # Action cost scaling
  
memory:
  decay_rate: [0.99, 0.995, 0.999]       # Memory forgetting rate
  memory_size: [256, 512, 1024]          # DNC memory slots
```

### Simulation-to-Reality Gap Mitigation

**The Challenge**: Agent might exploit simulator quirks instead of learning general concepts.

**Solution - Domain Randomization**:
- Physics parameter variation (gravity, friction, mass)
- Visual randomization (lighting, textures, camera noise)
- Temporal randomization (action delays, sensor noise)
- Multiple simulator backends (MuJoCo + PyBullet validation)

## Error Handling

### Prediction Failures
- **Symptom**: Prediction errors consistently increase
- **Response**: Trigger sleep cycle for model retraining
- **Fallback**: Reduce environment complexity temporarily

### Memory Overflow
- **Symptom**: Fast weight magnitudes exceed thresholds
- **Response**: Aggressive memory pruning during next sleep cycle
- **Prevention**: Regular decay of unused connections

### Energy Depletion
- **Symptom**: Energy approaching zero
- **Response**: Switch to energy-seeking behavior override
- **Consequence**: Death and reset if energy reaches zero

### Goal Invention Failure
- **Symptom**: No new goals discovered despite boredom
- **Response**: Increase exploration randomness
- **Fallback**: Manually inject environmental complexity

### Multi-Agent Deadlocks
- **Symptom**: All agents stuck in local minima
- **Response**: Inject random perturbations
- **Prevention**: Ensure sufficient environmental diversity

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- **Predictive Core**: Test prediction accuracy on synthetic sequences
- **Learning Progress**: Verify LP calculation with known error trajectories
- **Memory System**: Test Hebbian updates and retrieval accuracy
- **Energy System**: Validate energy consumption and death mechanics
- **Goal Invention**: Test clustering and goal generation algorithms

### Integration Testing
- **Core Loop**: Verify complete sensory-prediction-action cycle
- **Sleep Cycles**: Test memory consolidation and performance improvement
- **Multi-Agent**: Verify resource competition and interaction dynamics
- **Curriculum**: Test automatic complexity adjustment

### Behavioral Testing
- **Learning Progression**: Agent should show improving prediction accuracy
- **Goal Emergence**: New goals should appear when agent masters current ones
- **Social Dynamics**: Multi-agent scenarios should show cooperation/competition
- **Robustness**: Agent should recover quickly after death/reset
- **Boredom Response**: Agent should seek new challenges when current ones become trivial

### Performance Benchmarks
- **Prediction Accuracy**: Target 90%+ on familiar sensory patterns
- **Learning Speed**: 50% improvement in new task performance within 1000 steps
- **Memory Efficiency**: 80%+ retention of important patterns after sleep
- **Energy Management**: Survival rate > 80% in resource-scarce environments
- **Goal Achievement**: 70%+ success rate on self-generated goals
