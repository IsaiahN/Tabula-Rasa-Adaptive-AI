# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project aims to build an adaptive learning agent that develops intelligence through intrinsic motivation rather than external programming. The system is designed around a "digital childhood" paradigm where the agent learns through curiosity, boredom-driven exploration, and survival pressure. Unlike traditional AI systems that rely on external reward functions, this agent generates its own goals through learning progress maximization and maintains robustness through energy constraints and death mechanisms.

The core philosophy is that intelligence emerges from the right environmental conditions and internal drives, not from explicit programming of behaviors or goals.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Predictive Core Architecture

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want the agent to have a recurrent world-model that predicts sensory input, so that it can build an internal understanding of its environment through prediction accuracy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the agent receives sensory input THEN the system SHALL generate predictions for the next sensory state
2. WHEN prediction accuracy improves THEN the system SHALL update its internal world model accordingly
3. IF the agent encounters novel sensory patterns THEN the system SHALL adapt its predictive model to incorporate new information
4. WHEN the system makes predictions THEN it SHALL maintain a recurrent state that captures temporal dependencies

### Requirement 2: Learning Progress Drive

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want the agent to be intrinsically motivated by learning progress, so that it seeks out experiences that improve its predictive capabilities rather than pursuing arbitrary external rewards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN prediction error decreases over time THEN the system SHALL generate positive internal reward signals
2. WHEN prediction accuracy plateaus THEN the system SHALL experience "boredom" and seek new experiences
3. IF the agent encounters trivial or overly complex tasks THEN the system SHALL maintain learning progress in an optimal range
4. WHEN learning progress is maximized THEN the agent SHALL prefer actions that lead to such states

### Requirement 3: Embedded Memory System

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want memory to be integrated into the agent's thinking process, so that it can access and update memories without external database lookups that break the flow of cognition.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the agent processes information THEN memory updates SHALL occur as part of the forward pass
2. WHEN similar patterns are encountered THEN the system SHALL strengthen relevant memory connections through Hebbian-like updates
3. IF memory capacity is exceeded THEN the system SHALL prune less important memories during sleep cycles
4. WHEN retrieving memories THEN the process SHALL be differentiable and integrated with the prediction mechanism

### Requirement 4: Sleep and Dream Cycles

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want the agent to have offline processing periods, so that it can consolidate memories, prune irrelevant information, and strengthen important patterns without active sensory input.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the agent enters sleep mode THEN it SHALL replay high-prediction-error experiences
2. WHEN dreaming THEN the system SHALL compress and distill important patterns into long-term memory
3. IF memory contains redundant or low-value information THEN sleep cycles SHALL prune such data
4. WHEN waking from sleep THEN the agent SHALL demonstrate improved performance on previously challenging tasks

### Requirement 5: Energy and Survival Mechanism

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want the agent to have limited energy resources and face true death, so that it learns robust behaviors focused on survival rather than becoming overly specialized in irrelevant tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the agent takes actions THEN energy SHALL be consumed at a defined rate
2. WHEN the agent performs computations THEN energy SHALL decrease proportionally to computational cost
3. IF energy reaches zero THEN the agent SHALL experience catastrophic reset (death)
4. WHEN the agent finds energy sources THEN it SHALL replenish its energy reserves
5. IF the agent dies THEN it SHALL reset to initial conditions, losing current state but potentially retaining some learned patterns

### Requirement 6: Goal Invention System

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want the agent to generate its own goals from high-learning-progress experiences, so that it develops autonomous motivation rather than relying on externally defined objectives.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the agent experiences high learning progress THEN it SHALL cluster these states as potential goals
2. WHEN goals are achieved consistently THEN the system SHALL retire them and seek new challenges
3. IF no suitable goals exist THEN the agent SHALL explore until new goal candidates emerge
4. WHEN multiple goals are available THEN the system SHALL prioritize based on learning progress potential

### Requirement 7: Multi-Agent Environment

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want multiple agents to interact in a shared environment, so that social dynamics, competition, and cooperation emerge naturally from survival pressures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple agents share resources THEN competition SHALL emerge naturally
2. WHEN cooperation benefits survival THEN agents SHALL develop collaborative behaviors
3. IF deception provides survival advantage THEN agents SHALL potentially develop deceptive strategies
4. WHEN agents interact THEN communication patterns SHALL emerge based on utility for survival and learning progress

### Requirement 8: Adaptive Curriculum

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want the environment complexity to adapt to the agent's capabilities, so that it remains challenged at the edge of its competence without being overwhelmed or bored.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the agent's learning progress plateaus THEN environment complexity SHALL increase automatically
2. WHEN the agent struggles with current complexity THEN the system SHALL maintain current difficulty level
3. IF the agent masters current challenges THEN new environmental features SHALL be introduced
4. WHEN complexity changes THEN the transition SHALL be gradual to maintain learning continuity

### Requirement 9: Comprehensive Metrics and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want detailed metrics on learning progress, memory efficiency, and behavioral patterns, so that I can understand and optimize the agent's development process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the agent operates THEN the system SHALL track learning progress curves over time
2. WHEN memory operations occur THEN compression efficiency and retention metrics SHALL be recorded
3. IF the agent dies and resets THEN recovery speed SHALL be measured to assess robustness
4. WHEN social interactions occur THEN cooperation, competition, and communication patterns SHALL be logged
5. WHEN goals are invented or retired THEN goal lifecycle metrics SHALL be captured

### Requirement 10: Modular Architecture for Research

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want the system components to be modular and configurable, so that I can experiment with different algorithms and parameters for each subsystem.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the predictive core THEN it SHALL support different recurrent architectures (LSTM, Mamba, etc.)
2. WHEN configuring learning progress calculation THEN different mathematical formulations SHALL be testable
3. IF memory mechanisms need modification THEN they SHALL be swappable without affecting other components
4. WHEN running experiments THEN all hyperparameters SHALL be configurable through external configuration files
