# Sleep Cycle Adjustments Made

## Summary
Adjusted sleep cycle requirements to trigger more frequently during training sessions for better memory consolidation and learning verification.

## Changes Made

### 1. Energy System (src/core/energy_system.py)
- **Sleep threshold**: Increased from 20% to 40% of max energy
- **Effect**: Agent will sleep when energy drops below 40 instead of 20, triggering sleep cycles 2x more frequently

### 2. Sleep System (src/core/sleep_system.py)
- **Default sleep_trigger_energy**: Increased from 20.0 to 40.0
- **Effect**: System-wide default now triggers sleep at higher energy levels

### 3. Agent Configuration (src/core/agent.py)
- **Agent sleep_trigger_energy**: Increased from 20.0 to 40.0
- **Effect**: Agent initialization uses new higher threshold

### 4. Continuous Learning Loop (src/arc_integration/continuous_learning_loop.py)

#### A. Configuration
- **Demo agent sleep_trigger_energy**: Increased from 20.0 to 40.0

#### B. Dynamic Sleep Thresholds
- **With effective actions**: Increased from 0.4 to 0.6 base threshold
- **Without effective actions**: Increased from 0.2 to 0.5 threshold
- **Effect**: Sleep triggers at higher remaining energy levels

#### C. Energy Cost Reduction
- **Base energy cost**: Reduced from 0.15 to 0.08 per action
- **Effect**: Actions consume less energy, allowing more actions before sleep triggers

#### D. Sleep Trigger Conditions
- **Low energy trigger**: Increased from 20.0 to 40.0
- **Memory usage trigger**: Reduced from 0.9 to 0.7 (70% instead of 90%)
- **Periodic sleep**: Reduced from every 10 to every 5 episodes
- **Learning progress trigger**: Increased from 0.05 to 0.1

#### E. Mid-Game Sleep Triggers
- **Pattern accumulation**: Reduced from every 150 to every 75 actions
- **Learning signal threshold**: Reduced from 0.3 to 0.2 effectiveness
- **Energy threshold**: Increased from 60.0 to 70.0
- **Required actions**: Reduced from 20 to 15 actions
- **Effectiveness threshold**: Reduced from 0.2 to 0.15
- **Required effective actions**: Reduced from 5 to 3
- **Minimum sleep interval**: Reduced from 100 to 50 actions

## Expected Results

### Before Adjustments
- Sleep triggered when energy â‰¤ 20% (after ~667 actions at 0.15 cost/action)
- Infrequent sleep cycles in demo/short sessions
- High thresholds made sleep cycles rare during testing

### After Adjustments  
- Sleep triggered when energy â‰¤ 40% (after ~750 actions at 0.08 cost/action)
- More frequent sleep cycles due to:
  - Higher energy threshold (40% vs 20%)
  - Lower energy cost per action (0.08 vs 0.15)
  - More permissive trigger conditions
  - Shorter intervals between mid-game sleep cycles

### Verification
The changes should make sleep cycles and memory increments clearly visible during training sessions, allowing proper verification that the sleep/dream and memory consolidation systems are actively working.

## Next Steps
1. Run a training session with `python train_arc_agent.py --run-mode continuous --continuous-mode demo --enhanced --verbose`
2. Monitor for sleep cycle messages: `ðŸ˜´ Sleep triggered: ...` and `ðŸŒ… Sleep completed: ...`
3. Check `global_counters.json` for incremented sleep cycles and memory operations
4. Verify that sleep cycles now occur during shorter demo sessions
