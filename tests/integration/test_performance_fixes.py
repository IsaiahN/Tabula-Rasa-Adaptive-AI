Test the critical performance fixes for action limitations and continuous learning.

This tests the key fixes:
1. MAX_ACTIONS increased from 200 to 100,000
2. Available actions memory system
3. Enhanced boredom detection with strategy switching
4. Success-weighted memory prioritization (10x for wins)
5. Mid-game consolidation simulation
