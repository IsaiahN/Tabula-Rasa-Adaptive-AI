# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project aims to build an adaptive learning agent that develops intelligence through intrinsic motivation rather than external programming. The system is designed around a "digital childhood" paradigm where the agent learns through curiosity, boredom-driven exploration, and survival pressure. Unlike traditional AI systems that rely on external reward functions, this agent generates its own goals through learning progress maximization and maintains robustness through energy constraints and death mechanisms.

The core philosophy is that intelligence emerges from the right environmental conditions and internal drives, not from explicit programming of behaviors or goals.
