# AGI Gap Analysis: What's Missing for Human-Level Rapid Puzzle Solving

## Current System Capabilities (Good But Insufficient)

### ✅ What the System HAS:
- Basic pattern recognition (lines, rectangles, symmetry)
- Action selection and execution
- Memory systems and learning
- Meta-cognitive strategy switching
- Frame analysis and visual processing
- Goal acquisition and exploration

### ❌ What the System LACKS for AGI:

## 1. **HIERARCHICAL PATTERN ABSTRACTION**
**Human**: Instantly sees patterns at multiple scales (pixel → object → structure → rule)
**Current AI**: Only sees low-level features (colors, shapes, positions)

**The Gap**: Humans see "this is a rotation pattern" in 2 seconds. AI sees "red pixel at (3,4), blue pixel at (5,2)..."

## 2. **ANALOGICAL REASONING**
**Human**: "This puzzle is like that chess problem I solved" or "This is similar to folding paper"
**Current AI**: Each puzzle is treated as completely novel

**The Gap**: No transfer learning from other domains or puzzle types

## 3. **CAUSAL UNDERSTANDING**
**Human**: "If I click here, the blue pattern will mirror to the right side"
**Current AI**: "If I click here, some pixels might change"

**The Gap**: No understanding of WHY transformations happen

## 4. **COMPOSITIONAL REASONING**
**Human**: "This complex pattern = simple rotation + simple color swap"
**Current AI**: Sees everything as one monolithic pattern

**The Gap**: Can't decompose complex transformations into simple rules

## 5. **RAPID HYPOTHESIS GENERATION**
**Human**: Generates 3-5 competing hypotheses in 30 seconds
**Current AI**: Tests actions sequentially without clear hypotheses

**The Gap**: No systematic hypothesis space exploration

## 6. **WORKING MEMORY INTEGRATION**
**Human**: Holds multiple concepts simultaneously and relates them
**Current AI**: Processes information sequentially

**The Gap**: No parallel processing of competing explanations

## 7. **META-RULE UNDERSTANDING**
**Human**: "This is a 'complete the pattern' puzzle vs 'find the odd one out'"
**Current AI**: Doesn't classify puzzle types at meta-level

**The Gap**: No understanding of puzzle archetypes

## 8. **INTUITIVE PHYSICS AND SPATIAL REASONING**
**Human**: Built-in understanding of rotations, reflections, scaling
**Current AI**: No inherent spatial transformation understanding

**The Gap**: Must learn basic spatial concepts from scratch each time
