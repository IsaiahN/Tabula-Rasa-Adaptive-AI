# üß† Enhanced Governor & Architect Autonomy Plan

## **Current State Analysis**

### **Governor (EnhancedSpaceTimeGovernor)**
- ‚úÖ **Space-time awareness** for resource optimization
- ‚úÖ **4-Phase Memory Coordinator** integration
- ‚úÖ **Decision history** tracking
- ‚ùå **Limited autonomous decision-making**
- ‚ùå **Reactive rather than proactive**
- ‚ùå **No direct system modification capabilities**

### **Architect (Modular Architect)**
- ‚úÖ **Self-architecture evolution** system
- ‚úÖ **Sandboxed experimentation**
- ‚úÖ **Mutation engine** for safe changes
- ‚ùå **Requires Director approval** for changes
- ‚ùå **Limited real-time adaptation**
- ‚ùå **No direct Governor communication**

## **üéØ Vision: Autonomous Subsystem Leadership**

Transform Governor and Architect into **autonomous subsystem leaders** that can:
1. **Make independent decisions** without Director intervention
2. **Communicate directly** with each other
3. **Implement changes** autonomously within safe boundaries
4. **Learn and adapt** continuously
5. **Report to Director** only for high-level strategy
