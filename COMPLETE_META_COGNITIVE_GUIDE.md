## 🚀 Quick Start

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Run with meta-cognitive systems enabled
python train_arc_agent.py --mode sequential --salience decay --verbose

# The meta-cognitive layers will automatically activate if:
# - src/core/meta_cognitive_governor.py exists
# - src/core/architect.py exists
```

### Production Training
```bash
# Full production training with meta-cognitive optimization
python run_meta_cognitive_arc_training.py --run-full-training
```

### Testing and Validation
```bash
# Validate all meta-cognitive systems
python test_meta_cognitive_integration_safe.py

# Run interactive demonstration
python demo_meta_cognitive_training.py
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Components

### 1. MetaCognitiveGovernor ("Third Brain")
**File:** `src/core/meta_cognitive_governor.py`
**Purpose:** Real-time runtime optimization and resource allocation

#### Key Features:
- **37 System Monitors:** Tracks performance across all cognitive systems
- **Dynamic Optimization:** Adjusts configuration based on puzzle context
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis:** Makes intelligent resource allocation decisions
- **Issue Escalation:** Automatically escalates systemic problems to Architect

#### API Example:
```python
from src.core.meta_cognitive_governor import MetaCognitiveGovernor

governor = MetaCognitiveGovernor("governor.log")

recommendation = governor.get_recommended_configuration(
    puzzle_type="arc_competition",
    current_performance={'win_rate': 0.6, 'avg_score': 70},
    current_config={'max_actions_per_game': 1000}
)

print(f"Recommendation: {recommendation.type.value}")
print(f"Confidence: {recommendation.confidence:.1%}")
print(f"Changes: {recommendation.configuration_changes}")
```

### 2. Architect ("Zeroth Brain")
**File:** `src/core/architect.py`
**Purpose:** Safe recursive self-improvement through architectural evolution

#### Key Features:
- **SystemGenome:** Complete representation of system architecture
- **MutationEngine:** Generates safe architectural modifications
- **SandboxTester:** Validates changes in isolated environment
- **Evolution Cycles:** Autonomous improvement without human intervention

#### API Example:
```python
from src.core.architect import Architect

architect = Architect(base_path=".", repo_path=".")

# Autonomous evolution
result = await architect.autonomous_evolution_cycle()

# Process Governor requests
architect_request = governor.create_architect_request(
    issue_type="low_efficiency",
    problem_description="Performance plateau detected",
    performance_data={'win_rate': 0.5, 'efficiency': 0.3}
)
response = await architect.process_governor_request(architect_request)
```

### 3. Enhanced UnifiedTrainer
**File:** `train_arc_agent.py` (lines 738-753)
**Purpose:** Seamless integration with existing 37-cognitive-system architecture

#### Integration Points:
- **Initialization:** Automatically detects and initializes meta-cognitive systems
- **Learning Cycles:** Consults Governor for runtime optimization
- **Performance Tracking:** Feeds data to both Governor and Architect
- **Graceful Degradation:** Works normally if meta-cognitive systems unavailable

## 📊 Performance Monitoring

### Real-Time Metrics Tracked:
- **Win Rate:** Percentage of successfully solved puzzles
- **Average Score:** Mean performance across puzzle attempts  
- **Learning Efficiency:** Rate of improvement over time
- **Resource Utilization:** Computational cost per puzzle
- **System Health:** Status of all 37 cognitive systems

### Governor Decision Making:
```python
# The Governor analyzes multiple factors:
performance_metrics = {
    'win_rate': 0.65,
    'avg_score': 72,
    'learning_efficiency': 0.8,
    'resource_usage': 0.45
}

# And provides specific recommendations:
recommendations = [
    'parameter_adjustment',  # Tune existing settings
    'mode_switch',          # Change operational mode
    'feature_toggle',       # Enable/disable features
    'architecture_enhancement'  # Request Architect involvement
]
```

## 🧬 Autonomous Evolution Process

### Evolution Cycle Workflow:
1. **Performance Analysis:** Architect analyzes current system performance
2. **Mutation Generation:** Creates safe architectural modifications
3. **Sandbox Testing:** Tests changes in isolated environment
4. **Performance Validation:** Compares results against baseline
5. **Safe Integration:** Applies beneficial changes via Git branches
6. **Rollback Capability:** Can revert unsuccessful modifications

### Safety Mechanisms:
- **Sandboxed Execution:** All mutations tested in isolation
- **Performance Thresholds:** Only improvements above 5% threshold applied
- **Version Control:** Git-based tracking of all architectural changes
- **Automatic Rollback:** Failed experiments automatically reverted
- **Human Oversight:** Critical changes can require manual approval
