# Sleep System Data Integration Improvements

## Overview
Enhanced the sleep cycle system to better integrate with all data sources that the system gathers, ensuring comprehensive consolidation and analysis during sleep phases.

## Key Improvements Made

### ✅ **Enhanced Experience Integration**
- **ARC-3 Specific Data**: Sleep cycles now receive and process ARC-specific data including:
  - Action effectiveness patterns from continuous learning
  - Action semantic mappings and role understanding
  - Game-specific success strategies and patterns
  - Coordinate intelligence and boundary detection data
  - Frame analysis results and visual insights

- **Goal System Integration**: Sleep cycles now integrate with goal invention system:
  - Active goal success patterns and performance metrics
  - Emergent goals derived from high-salience experiences
  - Goal-action correlation patterns for better decision making

### ✅ **New Sleep Cycle Methods**

#### `_arc_aware_memory_consolidation()`
- Processes ARC-3 specific experience data during memory consolidation
- Strengthens memories based on action effectiveness patterns
- Applies context-specific memory boosting for different games
- Consolidates semantic understanding of action behaviors
- Tracks ARC-specific consolidation operations separately

#### `_integrate_goal_system_data()`
- Processes active and emergent goals during sleep
- Extracts goal success patterns for future reference
- Prioritizes memories related to successful goal achievement
- Integrates goal-driven insights into memory consolidation

#### Enhanced `add_experience()`
- Now accepts optional `arc_data` parameter for ARC-specific context
- Integrates action effectiveness, game context, and semantic data
- Enriches salient experience creation with comprehensive context

#### Enhanced `execute_sleep_cycle()`
- Added `arc_data` and `goal_data` parameters
- Implements multi-phase integration approach
- Tracks integration status for different data sources
- Provides detailed logging of integration activities

### ✅ **Integration Phases**

The enhanced sleep cycle now follows this comprehensive process:

1. **Memory Decay and Compression** - Standard salience-based processing
2. **Experience Replay** - Salience-weighted or traditional replay
3. **Object Encoding Enhancement** - Visual pattern consolidation
4. **Enhanced Memory Consolidation** - ARC-aware + salience-based consolidation
5. **Goal System Integration** - Goal pattern processing and insights
6. **Dream Generation** - Synthetic experience creation

### ✅ **Data Sources Now Fully Integrated**

| Data Source | Integration Status | Sleep Phase | Processing Method |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Action Effectiveness | ✅ Integrated | Phase 4 | ARC-aware consolidation |
| Action Semantics | ✅ Integrated | Phase 4 | Semantic understanding boost |
| Game Context Patterns | ✅ Integrated | Phase 4 | Context-specific memory boost |
| Coordinate Intelligence | ✅ Integrated | Phase 4 | Boundary detection consolidation |
| Goal Success Patterns | ✅ Integrated | Phase 5 | Goal-driven consolidation |
| Emergent Goals | ✅ Integrated | Phase 5 | High-priority memory strengthening |
| Frame Analysis Data | ✅ Integrated | Phase 4 | Visual intelligence consolidation |
| Salience Values | ✅ Enhanced | Phases 1-6 | All consolidation methods |
| Meta-Learning Insights | ✅ Enhanced | Phase 4 | Pattern-based consolidation |

### ✅ **Sleep Cycle Output Enhancement**

Sleep cycles now return comprehensive results including:
- `arc_data_integrated`: Boolean indicating ARC-specific data processing
- `goal_data_integrated`: Boolean indicating goal system data processing  
- `arc_specific_consolidations`: Count of ARC-aware memory operations
- `total_arc_experiences_processed`: Number of ARC-enhanced experiences
- `goals_processed`: Number of goals integrated during sleep
- `goal_consolidation_strength`: Cumulative goal-based consolidation priority

### ✅ **Benefits of Enhanced Integration**

1. **Comprehensive Memory Consolidation**: Sleep cycles now consider ALL data sources
2. **Context-Aware Processing**: Game-specific and action-specific memory strengthening
3. **Goal-Driven Learning**: Memory consolidation aligned with successful goal patterns
4. **ARC-3 Optimized**: Specialized processing for ARC puzzle solving contexts
5. **Better Prioritization**: Multiple data sources inform memory importance
6. **Enhanced Insights**: Richer dream generation and memory-informed guidance

## Usage Example

```python
# Enhanced sleep cycle execution with all data sources
sleep_results = sleep_system.execute_sleep_cycle(
    replay_buffer=experience_buffer,
    arc_data={
        'action_effectiveness': continuous_loop.available_actions_memory['action_effectiveness'],
        'game_context': {'game_id': current_game, 'session_data': session_info},
        'action_semantics': continuous_loop.available_actions_memory['action_semantic_mapping'],
        'coordinate_intelligence': boundary_detection_data
    },
    goal_data={
        'active_goals': goal_system.get_active_goals(),
        'emergent_goals': goal_system.get_emergent_goals(),
        'goal_success_patterns': goal_system.get_success_patterns()
    }
)

# Results now include comprehensive integration status
print(f"ARC data integrated: {sleep_results['arc_data_integrated']}")
print(f"Goal data integrated: {sleep_results['goal_data_integrated']}")
print(f"ARC consolidations: {sleep_results['arc_specific_consolidations']}")
```

## Impact on System Performance

The enhanced sleep system now provides:
- **Better Memory Utilization**: All gathered data informs memory consolidation
- **Improved Action Selection**: Sleep-consolidated ARC patterns guide future actions
- **Goal-Aligned Learning**: Memory strengthening aligned with successful goal pursuit
- **Context-Aware Adaptation**: Game-specific and situation-specific memory optimization
- **Comprehensive Data Processing**: No gathered data is left unconsidered during sleep

This ensures that the sleep/dream cycles are fully up to date with the latest data gathering methods and consider all available information during prioritization, analysis, and consolidation phases.
