## Future Development
To expand the system's capabilities, it will be connected to a World Simulator-LLM Hybrid, enabling the generation of worlds with increasing complexity for gradual exposure. The model will learn to solve challenging problems and eventually engage in "social learning" by interacting with other AI instances, improving through competition, imitation, and reverse-engineering.

Upon reaching competency, the model will be duplicated into a population of instances deployed across a suite of full-scale simulations. This population is governed by a Meta-Architect, which performs three critical functions:

Selection: Using Multi-Armed Bandit systems to identify the optimal agent for a given challenge.

Synthesis: Abstracting higher-level principles and cognitive strategies from successes and failures across all environments to weave a more generalized intelligence.

Directed Exploration: Proactively generating novel challenges to target the system's weaknesses and explore the boundaries of its understanding, transforming it into an active, self-directed learner.

This triad of functions is essential to overcome inherent limits. Without it, models risk overfitting to static environments or suffering from catastrophic forgetting in endlessly changing ones. The Meta-Architect actively prevents these evolutionary dead ends, ensuring continuous growth.

The ultimate objective is not merely to create an AI that wins a game, but to cultivate an intelligence that transcends it. This system generates agents capable of self-learning, self-refactoring, and becoming self-directed. The final outcome is an intelligence that learns to bend, break, or rewrite the rules of any simulated world laying the groundwork for AGI/ASI.
