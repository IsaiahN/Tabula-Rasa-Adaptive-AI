# Adaptive Learning Agent

An AI system that develops intelligence through intrinsic motivation, curiosity, and survival pressure rather than external programming.

## Overview

This project implements a "digital childhood" paradigm where an agent learns through:
- **Predictive Core**: Recurrent world-model that predicts sensory input
- **Learning Progress Drive**: Intrinsic motivation from prediction improvement
- **Embedded Memory**: Differentiable Neural Computer for integrated memory
- **Energy & Death**: Survival pressure through limited resources
- **Goal Invention**: Self-generated objectives from high-learning-progress experiences

## Development Phases

- **Phase 0** (Weeks 1-4): Component isolation and validation ✅
- **Phase 1** (Weeks 5-12): Integrated system development ✅ **CURRENT**
- **Phase 2** (Weeks 13-24): Complexity scaling and advanced features
- **Phase 3** (Month 7+): Multi-agent and emergent behaviors

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Research Goals

This system aims to validate the hypothesis that intelligence emerges from the right environmental conditions and internal drives, not from explicit programming of behaviors or goals.
