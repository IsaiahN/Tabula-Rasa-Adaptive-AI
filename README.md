# Tabula Rasa: Meta-Cognitive AI Architecture

A novel AI system that implements **meta-cognitive supervision** and **simulation-driven intelligence** for adaptive reasoning and autonomous evolution. Built for the ARC-AGI-3 challenge with unique architectural approaches to consciousness, memory management, and self-improvement.

## 🧠 Novel Architectural Contributions

### Meta-Cognitive Supervision
Unlike traditional AI systems that operate as black boxes, Tabula Rasa implements explicit meta-cognitive layers:

- **Governor System**: Runtime supervisor with 37 system monitors that actively manages cognitive resources and decision-making
- **Architect System**: Autonomous evolution engine that modifies its own architecture based on performance analysis
- **Recursive Self-Improvement**: Governor reports to Architect, which generates evolutionary directives back to Governor

### 4-Phase Memory Optimization
A unique approach to memory management that goes beyond simple storage:

1. **Pattern Recognition**: Detects memory access patterns and optimization opportunities
2. **Hierarchical Clustering**: Groups memories by causality, temporal patterns, and semantic similarity  
3. **Architect Evolution**: Uses memory analysis to drive architectural improvements
4. **Performance Optimization**: Real-time performance maximization using cross-phase intelligence

### Simulation-Driven Intelligence
Transforms reactive AI into proactive planning:

- **Multi-Step Planning**: Thinks 5-10 steps ahead instead of single-step decisions
- **Imagination Engine**: Runs internal simulations before taking real actions
- **Strategy Memory**: Stores successful action sequences as reusable strategies
- **Hypothesis Generation**: Creates "what-if" scenarios for strategic planning

## 🎯 Key Differentiators from Current AI/LLMs

### 1. **Autonomous Architecture Modification**
- Most AI systems have fixed architectures
- Tabula Rasa can modify its own structure based on performance feedback
- Implements safe evolutionary changes with rollback capabilities

### 2. **Meta-Cognitive Awareness**
- Traditional AI lacks self-awareness of its own cognitive processes
- Tabula Rasa monitors its own decision-making and resource allocation
- Provides transparent reasoning chains and decision justifications

### 3. **Cross-Session Learning with Persistence**
- Most systems start fresh each session
- Tabula Rasa maintains persistent learning state across sessions
- Implements breakthrough-only memory preservation to avoid catastrophic forgetting

### 4. **Simulation Before Action**
- Current AI is largely reactive
- Tabula Rasa simulates multiple futures before acting
- Uses emotional intelligence (energy, learning drive, boredom) to evaluate outcomes

### 5. **Hierarchical Memory with Semantic Understanding**
- Traditional systems treat all memories equally
- Tabula Rasa implements 5-tier memory hierarchy with breakthrough detection
- Only preserves memories when achieving new personal bests
