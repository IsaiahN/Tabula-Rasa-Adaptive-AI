# Human Puzzle-Solving Cognitive Process Analysis

## How Humans Solve ARC Puzzles in 2-5 Minutes

### Phase 1: Rapid Pattern Recognition (10-30 seconds)
- **Visual Gestalt**: Instantly see overall structure, symmetries, repetitions
- **Object Segmentation**: Automatically identify distinct objects/regions
- **Spatial Relationships**: Understand relative positions, sizes, orientations
- **Change Detection**: Compare input/output to see what transformed

### Phase 2: Rule Hypothesis Generation (30-60 seconds)
- **Analogical Reasoning**: "This looks like rotation/reflection/scaling"
- **Causal Models**: "If X, then Y" reasoning about transformations
- **Compositional Understanding**: "This rule = simple rule A + simple rule B"
- **Meta-pattern Recognition**: "This is a 'complete the pattern' type puzzle"

### Phase 3: Rapid Testing and Refinement (60-180 seconds)
- **Mental Simulation**: Test hypothesis without executing
- **Working Memory**: Hold 3-5 competing hypotheses simultaneously
- **Incremental Refinement**: Adjust rule based on new evidence
- **Transfer Learning**: Apply insights from similar puzzles instantly

### Phase 4: Execution and Verification (30-60 seconds)
- **Goal-Directed Action**: Execute based on understood rule
- **Real-time Adjustment**: Modify approach if results don't match expectation
- **Meta-cognitive Monitoring**: Know immediately if approach is wrong

## Key Human Cognitive Advantages
